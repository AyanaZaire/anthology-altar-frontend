            From a peephole in her grandmother’s garret that rests on her master’s property, a young woman watches while remaining concealed. Inspired by the autobiography of writer, abolitionist, and escaped slave girl Harriet Jacobs (1813-97), "Loophole of Retreat" locates a space of creation within places of capture. This self-reflexive production of freedom within incarceration - a hidden reality carved from within the center of power - served as our metaphor for this convening. An international constellation of writers, artists, poets, filmmakers, academics, and activists came together for a daylong gathering dedicated to the intellectual life of black women. Invited by artist Simone Leigh, feminist scholar Tina Campt, and cultural historian Saidiya Hartman, participants responded through papers, readings, and performance.
