I have been taught how to be perfect, but not how to live. The author as usual feels implicated in this. I don't mind, the clerk quickly decides. This tendency for self-implication in the author only elicits more leaves and at this moment the clerk is inundated, thinking of the smell of the earth the author has just brought in with her. The ground smelled like fresh ploughed earth outside the Robarts Library and the clerk thought of the books inside and how, collected there in stacks, they have returned to their original selves as trees and earth, and how difficult it must be for them to be wrenched open again and again to be read and read even as they are returning, reaching through each other and the concrete boat around them. That is why it smells like new ploughed ground around the library. The author brings this smell with her sometimes, it is on her fingers and in her hair as if she's done some work in dirt and then reached for her head absentmindedly.",

            "poem": "Someone who knew me well \nAnd that I'd lived \nIn many a gray shack \nMy mother transformed \nWith flowers \nTook me to your house \nTo meet you: \nTo see the shacks \nYou rescued from our shame \nAnd transformed with your wit, \nSmall nails, old boards, \nAnd paint. \nI was enchanted to see \nMy mother's magic \nEmerge \nFrom the end \nOf your brush. \nNow you have left us. The streaming \nLight through all your shacks'  \nCracks \nLike the streaming genius \nOf your own obsessed mind. \nHow do we make new \nAnd restorative of soul \nThe old pain? How do we learn  \nTo carry with grace and humor  \nAll that has happened to us?  \nBuchanan, for instance. Whose name  \nWas that before it was slapped across  \nThe memory of the enslaved?  \nYour ancestors \nIn Africa were not Buchanans \nAnd may have been esteemed artists  \nEvery one of them,  \nFor all we know. \nAh, Beverly, \nAll of us in our age clan \nAre in the homestretch now.  \nWe will not be far behind you. \nTrailing our chalk, our pencil sticks \nWith which we wrote and drew in the dirt, \nOur paints made from berries, barks, \nAnd tears. \nWith open hands \nWe have offered our art \nMade from whatever scraps \nWere left over from our destruction, \nTheir absence from \nThe big house table of greed and ignorance \nNever missed. \nThis poem is to say how glad I am \nTo have the shack \nYou made for me. Red as a strawberry! \nI would never have thought of that; yet \nHow right it has turned out to be. \nFor I do not wallow in sadness \nThough it visits more often these days \nThan I would like; \nThe world is dying \nIn so many ugly ways \nAnd humans with it. \nAnd yet, against all odds \nI realize \nThere will always be a Beverly Buchanan  \nArising from a virtual \"nowhere\" \nTo cobble together the broken pieces \n—Left over from the beauty \nThat is destroyed— \nAnd paint them red \nFor dancing.",
